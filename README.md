# Floyd Warshall Algorithm
## Using Python Recursive Function

### Project Description. 
Floyd’s algorithm finds a shortest path distance between two nodes on a graph. This code replaces loop with recursive function and is a re-written version of Python imperative solution which shows a simple implementation of Floyd’s algorithm and returns a graph matrix. 
The solution picks a node and then calculates the distance between every start and end node. It also includes the intermediate node as part
of the indirect path. Then it compares distances of direct and indirect paths between given start and end nodes and selects the shortest path and updates the distance graph accordingly.
